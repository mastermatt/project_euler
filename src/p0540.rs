// Counting primitive Pythagorean triples
//
// A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers  and  satisfying .
// The triple is called primitive if  and  are relatively prime.
// Let P() be the number of primitive Pythagorean triples with .
// For example P(20) = 3, since there are three triples: (3,4,5), (5,12,13) and (8,15,17).
//
// You are given that P(106) = 159139.
// Find P(3141592653589793).
